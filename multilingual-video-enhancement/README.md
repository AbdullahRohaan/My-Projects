# Multilingual Video Enhancement System

## Overview
The Multilingual Video Enhancement System is an AI-based project designed to improve the accessibility of educational videos. It processes video input to enhance audio quality, convert speech to text, translate content into multiple languages, and generate improved outputs using Python-based AI techniques.

## Key Features
- Audio extraction from video files
- Speech-to-text transcription
- Multilingual translation of transcripts
- Audio enhancement and synchronization
- End-to-end automated processing pipeline

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Speech-to-Text (ASR)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Audio and Video Processing Libraries

## Project Workflow
1. Input video is provided to the system  
2. Audio is extracted from the video  
3. Speech recognition converts audio to text  
4. Transcripts are translated into target languages  
5. Enhanced audio and translated outputs are generated  

## Use Case
This project focuses on making educational and informational video content accessible to a wider audience by overcoming language barriers and improving audio clarity.

## What I Learned
- Designing AI pipelines for multimedia data
- Working with speech recognition and translation systems
- Integrating multiple AI components into a single workflow
- Handling real-world audio and video processing challenges
